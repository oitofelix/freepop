@c This file is intended to provide the latest release news for the
@c 'NEWS.texi' and 'ANNOUNCEMENT.texi' files to avoid duplication of
@c information and syncing work.  After a release is made the news items
@c below should be moved to the 'NEWS.texi' file and another list should
@c be built from scratch here.

@noindent @strong{Behavior changes:}

working directory, to make this legacy mechanism compatible with
symbolic links.

ordinary floor. @item Spurious collisions happen when the kid is
climbing at the limits of a room linked to itself.
@item The kid can't hang turn properly in a hangable place with a
closed door in the opposite direction he's facing.
@item Spikes kill kid in the last few frames of landing after a normal jump.
@item @code{BIG_LIFE_POTION} doesn't fill all life points, if
the kid has the maximum amount of life point containers.
@item Legacy level module ignore guards with invalid palette.
@item Skeleton doesn't hold his sword when falling.
@item Interrupting a video effect before its end results in normal
draw cycles being skipped.
