@emph{Menininho} is the Brazilian Portuguese word for @emph{male kid},
and @emph{mininim} is how it's informally pronounced throughout the
country.  @emph{Kid} is the term used by @emph{Jordan
Mechner}@footnote{Jordan Mechner (born June 4, 1964) is an American
video game designer, author, screenwriter, and filmmaker, best known for
creating the Prince of Persia video game franchise and the 8-bit
computer game Karateka.} when referring to the main character of his
most famous game --- @strong{Prince of Persia} --- in its source code
and documentation, because the character's movements were derived from
rotoscoping footage of Mechner's little brother.  @strong{MININIM} is
the @emph{Advanced Prince of Persia Engine}, written from scratch by
computer programmer and free software activist @emph{Bruno Félix Rezende
Ribeiro} (@code{oitofelix}).  Bruno had a childhood dream of deciphering
the secrets of his favorite game that introduced him to computing --- a
dream dreamt when he was just a kid, a dream realized now that he's
still a @emph{mininim} deep in his heart.@footnote{Of course, none of
this is reason enough to name a game engine ``MININIM'', if not by the
fact that it's a really cool palindrome!}

MININIM is the Advanced Prince of Persia Engine --- a childhood dream,
the free software implementation of Jordan Mechner's masterpiece game,
