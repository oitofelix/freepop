<blockquote markdown="1">
_Menininho_ is the Brazilian Portuguese word for _male kid_, and
_mininim_ is how it's informally pronounced throughout the country.
_Kid_ is the term used by _Jordan Mechner_<sup>1</sup> when referring
to the main character of his most famous game --- __Prince of Persia__
--- in its source code and documentation, because the character's
movements were derived from rotoscoping footage of Mechner's little
brother.  __MININIM__ is the _Advanced Prince of Persia Engine_, written
from scratch by computer programmer and free software activist _Bruno
Félix Rezende Ribeiro_ (`oitofelix`).  Bruno had a childhood dream of
deciphering the secrets of his favorite game that introduced him to
computing --- a dream dreamt when he was just a kid, a dream realized
now that he's still a _mininim_ deep in his heart.<sup>2</sup>

__MININIM__ is the _Advanced Prince of Persia Engine_ --- a childhood
dream, the free software implementation of _Jordan Mechner_'s
masterpiece game, developed from scratch by _Bruno Félix Rezende
Ribeiro_ (`oitofelix`).  _MININIM is free software_; you can
redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the
[GNU General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html) as
published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 3, or (at
your option) any later version.

In addition to being already a complete replacement for the original
game with several improvements, MININIM aims to have detailed
documentation on all matters concerning the original Prince of Persia
world, ranging from its design concepts to the engine’s practical use
and development.  _MININIM documentation is free_; you can
redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the
[GNU FDL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl.html) (Free Documentation
Licence) as published by the FSF — with no Invariant Sections; either
version 1.3, or (at your option) any later version.

MININIM features various improvements over the original game, too many
to make an exhaustive list here.  Some of its noteworthy features
currently implemented are:

- Portable to modern operating systems
- Generalized multi-room support
- Video, environment, hue and guard modes may be selected on-the-fly

  when appropriate
- Real-time responsiveness, higher world interaction accuracy, more
  stable animations, smoother collision and robust physics
- New useful movements: normal jump hang, normal jump turn, running
  jump hang, running jump turn, hanging fall, hanging turn, falling
  turn, take sword anywhere
- Complete level editor based on non-intrusive mode-line menus and
  mouse selection
- Unlimited undo/redo for level changes
- Integrated configuration system using multiple back-ends
- Native (fully expressive) level format
- Capability of loading level files in multiple formats: native,
  legacy, PLV and DAT

  constructions

The following videos demonstrate features that are already implemented
and will come up in the next release.  If you like MININIM and want to
show your appreciation or enable oitofelix to spend more time on its
development (so these features come out faster and better),

has a podcast episode from august 2016 titled _Recriando Prince of
Persia: Dois Projetos Brasileiros_ (Recreating Prince of Persia: Two
Brazilian Projects) for which Bruno Félix (oitofelix) was invited to
talk about MININIM.

A Youtube playlist of a full walkthrough of the standard Prince of
Persia legacy level set, using MININIM's replay capabilities is also
[available](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSibI2wnwb-Yf1bhWygaC-2Q8XcmJ8D0I)
at oitofelix's channel.

MININIM has been included in Jordan Mechner's 30th anniversary edition
of "The Making of Price of Persia".  It appears in section "Legacy",
on page 321.  Jordan sent a signed copy of the book to oitofelix,
which you can see below.

Attached is a screenshot of MININIM, the free software Advanced Prince
of Persia Engine I wrote from scratch in C and Lua, using the Allegro
low-level game library and the IUP widget tool kit.

Its features include Macintosh video mode (DOS VGA/EGA/CGA also
availale) multiroom dsplay, real-time level editor GUI, and Lua REPL
for on-the-fly scripting.

### Download

MININIM is under constant and fast development.  It uses a rolling
release scheme, meaning that updated versions are often released as
soon as new features have been implemented or bugs have been fixed.
This way the latest developments are always available to an wider
audience.  Notice that its version number reflects the date of
release.

[Its user's manual (in PDF format)](https://github.com/oitofelix/mininim/releases/download/v201701122309/mininim.pdf)
is bundled in the hope that it might be useful, but keep in mind that
it lags far behind the current development stage of MININIM and thus
doesn't describe several features thereof accurately or at all.  The
author plans to update MININIM's documentation in a definitive manner
when MININIM reaches reasonable feature-set stability.  In case you'd
like to help in speeding up this process by maintaining its
documentation, you're very welcome!  Please, contact the MININIM
community at its
[forum](http://forum.princed.org/viewforum.php?f=127).


**Windows**

   If you are under Microsoft Windows a MinGW build is readily
available.  No installation is required, just extract the zip archive
and run ‘mininim.exe’.

[mininim-201701122309-win32.zip](https://github.com/oitofelix/mininim/releases/download/v201701122309/mininim-201701122309-win32.zip)


**GNU/Linux**

  If you use GNU/Linux, you have to clone its
[VCS repository](https://github.com/oitofelix/mininim) and build it
yourself.  It should be quite straightforward --- just follow the
advice given at its GitHub page.  If you are planning to build Allegro
from source consider using
[oitofelix's fork](https://github.com/oitofelix/allegro5) for best
results.  It may have improvements brought to the library through
MININIM.
